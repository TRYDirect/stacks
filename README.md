# Application stacks
A collection of docker-compose files and initial configuration files for most popular open source apps


Hello to all IT folks out there,
We are a small team of developers and devopses who want to improve the way of deployments of most popular open-source and custom application stacks using docker-compose.

If you want to improve or implement docker-compose stack deployments, you are welcome!
Propose new application stack or contribute new ideas at https://github.com/trydirect/stacks/issues

We would also like to invite people who:
1. want to learn more about Dockerfile and docker-compose
2. are trying to get technical writing experience
3. want to be a part of opensource
